## 🏗️ Hierarchical Structure

MsgSync supports an N-tier hierarchy, allowing for any number of reseller levels.

1.  **Admin (Root)**: Full control over the platform, system-wide analytics, and global provider management.
2.  **Reseller**: Can create and manage their own sub-resellers and clients. Resellers purchase bulk credits from the Admin and distribute them to their own sub-accounts.
3.  **Client**: The end-user of the messaging services. Clients use credits for sending messages, running campaigns, and OTP verification.

### Data Isolation
All messages, campaigns, and contact lists are isolated at the organization level. Parents can view aggregated reports for their children but cannot see sensitive message content or private contact details unless permissions are explicitly granted.

## 📈 Billing & Credits

### Balance Management
Every organization has a `balance` field (Decimal). When a message is sent, the platform checks for sufficient balance before placing the job in the queue.

### Transaction Types
- **CREDIT**: Adding funds to an organization (e.g., via top-up or parent distribution).
- **DEBIT**: Consumption of funds (e.g., sending messages or recurring platform fees).

### Payment Gateway
The billing portal supports several simulated payment methods:
- **Stripe**: Credit/Debit card processing.
- **PayPal**: Digital wallet payments.
- **Crypto**: Secure, decentralized payments via Bitcoin/Lightning.

---

## 📊 Reporting & Analytics

Each level in the hierarchy has access to a **Client-Specific Reporting Portal** which includes:
- **Volume Statistics**: Total messages sent vs. failed.
- **Status Distribution**: Real-time breakdown of message states (Delivered, Pending, Error).
- **Financial History**: A searchable ledger of all credits and payments.
- **Efficiency Trends**: Delivery success rate visualization over time.
